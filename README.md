## ü§î How to use it
Due to the current incomplete nature of SocialFollower you cannot access it online yet, but you can clone this repo and run ```npm run dev``` in the corresponding folder. 
You will also need to create a locally hosted appwrite to have a working local login etc.

### Register and Login
Because the landing page hasn't been designed yet, you will need to head to ```localhost:5713/register``` or ```localhost:5173/login``` respectively

## ü§® How it was made

### Frontend
The frontend was made using React, Typescript, Tailwind, shadcn, and Storybook to customize individual components

### Backend
The backend is achieved using Appwrite, which is responsible for most of the authentication, the database etc. I used react-router-dom as the router for the application
